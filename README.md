 <h1>Creating an Amazon Home Page Clone: My First Web Development Project</h1><br>
    <p>I have successfully created a clone of the Amazon home page using only HTML and CSS. This project marks my <i>initial foray into the world of web development</i>. By leveraging fundamental concepts of web design, I crafted the entire page without the aid of JavaScript or any web development frameworks. This endeavor has provided me with a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, setting the stage for more advanced projects in the future.</p>gi
